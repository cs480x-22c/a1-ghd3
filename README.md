Assignment 1 - Hello World: GitHub and d3- Carley Gilmore  
===


1. Your project should contain at least four kinds of graphics primitives (circles, rectangles, lines, polygons) in different colors. 

My project is an 8 Ball fortune teller. It consists of a rectangle base "shadow", two circles to make the 8 ball, a polygon of an upside down triangle, text, and two different colored lines on the page for design. Each of these elements have different colors

2. Your document should identify the source of the code if you start with code that you found. 
I referred to the first lecture of class for design and structure of the code while also looking to StackOverflow for answers on how to make a text block with the SVG.

3. Your code should be forked from the GitHub repo and linked using GitHub pages. See the "GitHub Details" section below for detailed instructions on how to do this.

    - A description of what you have created. 1-2 screenshots are recommended for the README.  
    The screenshots attached showcase the functionality of the technical aspect of the fortune teller


    - A working link to the hosted files (usually the gh-pages 'live' url)

    - Section for Technical and Design Achievements

Technical Achievement Description- For my technical achievement I made a dataset of the different types of responses a user could get from clicking on the triangle in the center of the 8 ball. I have an OnClick event that changes the triangles color from blue to purple on click and then prompts the user with a message that is randomly generated from the dataset.

Design Achievement Description 
For my design, I wanted to go for a simple geometric design that allowed me to layer and play around with different shapes in D3. I also wanted the design to be something that the user can clearly interact with and recognize. I stuck to basic colors using the classic black and white for the 8 ball and blue and for the triangle with a color change so that the user knows they clicked on the ball
