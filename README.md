Assignment 1 - Hello World: GitHub and d3  
===

For this project the user is to interact with a circle and a rectangle. The goal is to drag and drop the shapes into a box at the bottom of the page. When the user drags the shape within the bounds of the box, user will be alerted of their success.
The user has these capabilities when interacting with these shapes:
 - Mouseover the shapes: when mousing over a given shape, the shape will change color. Mouse out of the shape: when the mouse is no longer over the shape, the shape will return to it's original color. The following images show the color change in the mouse over of the circle.

 - Selection: The user has the option to select the shape by clicking on it. The first click will change the color to yellow. When clicked again, the shape will revert back to its' original color. Addiotionally, if the shape is selected when the object is placed in the box, it will return to it's original color. 
 - Drag and Drop: The user can drag a shape by clicking and holding down on the mouse. The user can drop the item by letting go of the mouse.
 
Design Acheivements:
- These mouse over and out capabilities will allow the user clearly idenitfy what shape there mouse is hovering over. This could be more helpful when more shapes are added to the game. 
- The yellow selection will also help users who might want to highlight the shape they are working on to see it more clearly.

- An alert that is color coordinated with the shape, will help validate the user when they have completed the task.

GitHub Details
---

- Fork the GitHub Repository for Assignment 1. You now have a copy associated with your username.
- Make changes to index.html to fulfill the project requirements. 
- Make sure your "main" branch matches your "gh-pages" branch. See the GitHub Guides referenced above if you need help.
- Edit the README.md with a link to your gh-pages site "http://YourUsernameGoesHere.github.io/01-ghd3/index.html".



Grading
---

Grades are on a 120 point scale. 
96 points will be graded for functionality: the program does what the assignment requests with an informative README. 

We will use Google Chrome to view submissions. 
Be sure to test your code there.

Below are some, but not necessarily all, of the key points we will consider during grading:

- Circles and Rectangles  
- Lines  
- Polygons  
- Different colors  
- README Quality
    - A description of what you have created. 1-2 screenshots are recommended for the README.  
    - A working link to the hosted files (usually the gh-pages 'live' url)  
    - Section for Technical and Design Achievements

Technical Achievement Desription -- 12  
Design Achievement Description -- 12

Remember, it is up to *you* to define what constitutes a technical and design achievements.
Be ambitious as these are designed to allow you to shape your learning.
These are the only way to move from B to A territory.
