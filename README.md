I created a simple website using javascript and  HTML. The website is not functional and it does not have a purpose. I experimented with different SVGs, also learned how .append in javascript.

Most of the work was experimental. I did not try to build anything. I was experimenting with javascript and d3.

I had trouble setting up a live server but I was able to finish that using vs code and node.js.I encountered difficulties trying to make polygons in d3. I used online resources to make the polygons and the animations. 

What I learned :
* I learned the chaining syntax. 
* SVG line , rect ,path , line (x1 ,y1 )
* Selection, using D3 to data join and D3 to add multiple SVG at once
* Loading data from external data  
* Scales , syntax for sales 

 Technical and Design Achievements :
- Learned HTML, JAVASCRIPT and D3
