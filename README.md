Assignment 1 - Hello World: GitHub and d3  
===

Source: I started with the code done in class on 1/12/21.

Link to gh-pages site: https://hgsmith-wpi.github.io/a1-ghd3/ 

Description:
---

My assignment displays four flowers. Each of them have a flower pot, a stem, a round center, and four petals. 
Each element of the flower is a different graphics primitive and they are all different colors.
You can click or "pluck" the petals and they will fall to the ground.

Technical Achievements:
---

- I used an onclick event to pluck the petals
- I also animated the petals by using transform and translate in d3

Design Achievements:
---

- I used the required shapes to create multiple flowers 
- I used color schemes in d3 to easily change the colors of the parts of the flowers
