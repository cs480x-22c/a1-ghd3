title: Assignment 1

Description: For this project I created the primitive shapes (circles, rectangles, lines, polygons)

Author: Craig Dunn (cj) github:cjdunn2

Details:
    This project contains four primitive shapes all done slightly differently.
    I worked on different methods of creation by altering my atribute per shape
    This can be seen clearly in the polygon shape as the first time I attemptedd I used a hard coded array within the .attr field. After which I then used an array
    made outside of the function.
