README

Hi! I hope you enjoyed checking out my first project! A couple things to note:

**The following were made compeltely from scratch:
- CIRCLE: I used a double for-loop and d3.rgb to create all of the circles
- RECTANGLE: In the center is a black rectangle
- LINE: Crossing the black rectangle from corner to corner are 2 separate white lines making an 'X' shape
- POLYGON: In the very center of the black rectangle is a white octagon. I originally wanted to make this a different color than the lines, but looking at it reminded me of an optical illusion. I thought it was neat/slightly eye catching, so I kept it.

**Finally, we have the last part I implemented:
- ON-CLICK EVENT: On mouse click on the svg, my js code generates a polygon, colored based on the mouse's coordinates (since I couldn't figure out how to do random number gen). This code is mostly original (e.g. heavily changed to the point that it is almost completely different), but I felt I should mention that it is **based loosely on the on-click event example we covered in the first day of class.**

That's about all. This took a lot of trial and error, but I had a lot of fun while making it, and I didn't want to just put 4 shapes on an svg and call it a day. Hope you liked it!
