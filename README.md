Sophia Strano's Assignment 1 - Hello World: GitHub and d3 
===

For this assignment, being very new to JS, html and d3, I consulted multiple articles to learn more about the basics of creating primitives. I mainly modeled my code with examples from http://www.d3noob.org/2014/02/d3js-elements.html and https://www.d3-graph-gallery.com/intro_d3js.html to gain a basic understanding the relationship between html and JS, and to reference basic syntax to generate primitives. 

Technical Achievements -- 

Considering that I have only ever used GitHub for the sake of having a profile, and that I have never used any of these languages or libraries, I was happy with the advancements I made during the project, between practicing the use of GitBash and viewing my changes more quickly by loading the html file directly into my browser. In addition to getting more comfortable with the general usage of JS and d3 to create shapes, I was able to create a scale for both the x and y axis to scale the shapes I've created more appropriately. After figuring out the appropriate height and width for my SVG I was struggling to get a relative idea of where shapes would actually appear on the screen, so creating a visible scale on both axis from 0 to 100 served as a guide to decide what positions I wanted primitvies to appear, and to ensure they appeared in the expected location. 
Design Achievement Description -- 12
I wanted to make a turtle, however this proved to be extremely difficult. I was able to practice moving, resizing, and smoothing the edges of shapes to make design advancements.
