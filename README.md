Assignment 1 - Hello World: GitHub and d3  
===

For my Assignment 1, I decided to create a picture. This picture contains a car on the road at a stop sign. The sun is out, and there are clouds in the sky. Some source code that I used was compiled from different websites including [Create SVG elements](https://www.tutorialsteacher.com/d3js/create-svg-elements-in-d3js#:~:text=var%20svg%20%3D%20d3.select%20%28%22body%22%29.append%20%28%22svg%22%29.attr%20%28%22width%22%2C%20width%29.attr,svg%2C%20so%20that%20we%20can%20use%20it%20later.) which I used for creating text inside of a polygon, [How to Draw a Line in d3](https://webdva.github.io/how-to-draw-a-line-in-d3js/) for drawing lines, and Professor's code from class. The link to my "gh-pages" branch is "http://vlm-wpi.github.io/01-ghd3/index.html" and the page should look like this: (insert screenshot here)

Design Achievement Description
---

In this project, I was able to create a picture using lines, polygons, circles, and rectangles. When I first started playing around with d3, I tried to make a polygon and the first shape that popped into my head was an octagon, and the color I chose was red. Once I created this shape, I realized that it looked like a stop sign, and started to design the rest of my picture around that. I then had a circle in the upper right hand corner of the page, and decided to make it the sun, containing thick lines coming off of the sun as rays
