This is a simple fun racing game where users have to guess how fast the automated racers are going. Although the concept is simple, it incorporates many design elements, including: 
    - the incorporation of shapes, lines, and colors
    - moving of shapes using transformations and resetting their locations
    - changing of colors
    - incorporation of classic javascript with normal buttons, radio buttons, and a slider
