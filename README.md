Assignment 1 - Hello World: GitHub and d3  
===

For this project I made an aesthetic and colorful visualization containing circles, rectangles, lines, polygons and text. The visualization includes animation when the shapes are clicked.
Here is an image of what my visualization initially looks like: https://github.com/marsacben/a1-ghd3/blob/master/BeforeAnimation.JPG
Here is an image of what my visualization looks like after all the animations are activated by clicking on the shapes:
