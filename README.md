Assignment 1 - Hello World: GitHub and d3  
===
Hi!
This is my A1 assignment site here: https://alexiscaira.github.io/a1-ghd3/ using d3 and graphics/animations made by me.
You can see that I was able to use primitive graphics like circles, rectangles, and polygons at different locations on the screen with different colors to make the moon, cow, spaceship, and star. From there I animated it using D3 to have the spaceship and cow move together back and forth on screen and the star twinkling on and off in the sky. For the background, I used Canva to generate a SVG transparent background, which features the barn, fence, and grass on screen.

From there, I imported it in the style page, and added the night sky blue in the background.

Vis Details/Technical and Design Achievements
---

For this vis, for my design achievements I utitlized an outside tool for making svg graphics (paths) for the background, called Canva, which I then imported to the project. This saved me some time compared to making custom paths for things like the grass over and over. This let me focus on my other design goal, which was making the cow and spaceship out of shapes by hand. For the star, I used color transitions and animations to make it look like it was twinkling. I modified the radius of the curves and implemented style attributes outside of what we reviewed in class by using W3School articals that explained what each value was. For tech achivemvements, I animated the spaceship and cow by hand using D3 and expirmaneted with transistion settings we did not go over in class.
