Orest Ropi

Credit to: For this project I used parts of the the code from the first class as well as learning from https://developer.mozilla.org/.

Project Description: Interact with diffrent types of shapes in a "shape playbox" by clicking on them. Shapes move, change size, and change color. The shape that is being modified will be displayed in the bottom left corner. Refreshing the page will reset the "playbox".

**Technical Achievement Desription -- 12**

- **Was able to launch my program on another website host**: This allows me to not need to have a project on github to launch it.

- **Shapes move when clicked**: They move in all types of directions.

- Shapes change size when clicked: They will grow, get smaller, or remain the same size.

- Shapes change color when clicked: Some change color completely some are inverted.

- Some shapes are reliant on a dataset, while others are manually inputed.

- Shapes sit on the edge of the svg when they float or fall. This allows for a cool effect and maximum space efficiency.

- Polygons have depth of colors.


**Design Achievement Description -- 12**

- **Created color palette using adobe**: I used the hash numbers from my palette. Changing color of some shapes, text, and background-color.

- **Used the Ubuntu Font from Google Fonts**: I used Ubuntu as the font for the primary copy text in my site.

- **I asked for feedback from my brother who tested the program**: Indicated the lines and edges were not thick enough, so I decided to research how to make them thicker(changed  stroke-width attribute).

- I made a title using intresting colors, that also gives an idea of what the website is about.

- I placed the shapes so they appear to be attached to the line, and similar to a music note.

- Indicator for what shape/id number is shown on the bottom left, to allow a user to make sure the website is running correctly.
