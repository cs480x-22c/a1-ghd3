Technical Achievement Desription -- 12 

This program generates several random shapes using d3 (lines, rectangles, circles, and a polygon)
with random dimensions. I used some simple built-in Math functions and a for-loop to generate the 
shape dimensions. I also found a random color generator and used that to randomize the colors of the shapes.

Design Achievement Description -- 12

This was my first time using github for something like this and also my first time using JavaScript,
so getting the page to display the way I wanted it to wasn't as easy as I'd hoped, 
but I'm still happy with how it turned out.
