![Fun 90s Website](/90s.PNG)

For my project, I made a minimal assignment that then transforms into a 90sish website after clicking the text at the top. After clicking on the paragraph tag the top switches to marquee, and it allows you to then click on each of the elements. The clicking code was adapted from the [Class 1 example code](https://wpi0-my.sharepoint.com/personal/ltharrison_wpi_edu/_layouts/15/onedrive.aspx?id=%2Fpersonal%2Fltharrison%5Fwpi%5Fedu%2FDocuments%2FSpring%202022%2Fcs480x%2D22c%2Fvid%2F2022%2D01%2D12%2013%2E00%2E20%20cs480x%2D22c%2Fd3start%2Ezip&parent=%2Fpersonal%2Fltharrison%5Fwpi%5Fedu%2FDocuments%2FSpring%202022%2Fcs480x%2D22c%2Fvid%2F2022%2D01%2D12%2013%2E00%2E20%20cs480x%2D22c). Clicking on the rectangle rotates it. This was adapted from ["Wrapping my head around D3 rotation transitions"](https://www.guidodiepen.nl/2018/07/wrapping-my-head-around-d3-rotation-transitions/). Clicking on the circle changes the background body color. Clicking on the line changes its color and thickness. Lastly clicking the pentagon turns it into a triangle. The CSS included ensures that the SVG element will always be as large as possible.
