Circle
---
I made a circle in the top left of the svg and made it a light green color. When you hover over the circle, text will appear and tell you
the number of times you have clicked on the circle. This text will stay near the cursor as you move it. The circle will also become slightly larger so it is more obvious when you are hovering on it. When you click on the circle, it will change through a set of colors. It'll get darker for each click then go back to the light green. Each color will appear every 6th time. The number of clicks will update.

Rectangle
---
The rectangle is the same as the circle, except it is in shades of blue.

Line
---
I made a red line in the bottom left of the svg. When you click on the line, rather than changing color, the stroke-width of the line will increase by 4 pixels. Since the size is changing when you click, I decreased the opacity when you hover over the line. Then the hovering won't interfere with the size of the line when you click. The number of clicks appears the same as the circle and rectangle.

Polygon
---
I made a polygon and chose to decrease the opacity when you hover over it, like the line. When you click on the polygon it will rotate 90 degrees clockwise around the location of the cursor. The number of clicks appears the same as the others.

Technical Achievement Description
---
- I made the objects interactive by changing color, increasing stroke-width, or rotating when you click on them.
- When you hover on the object the number of clicks will appear and tell you how many times you clicked on the object. The object will also either get slightly larger or decrease opacity.
- The number of clicks text stays next to the cursor as you move it.

Design Achievement Description
---
- I chose a different color for each shape.
- For the circle and rectangle, I found a palette of different shades of green and blue. I chose to make them larger when you hover over them and not change the opacity. Since the color is changing when you click, it would confusing if both hovering and clicking changed the shade of color.
- For the line, I chose the opposite and decreased the opacity rather than increasing the size when you hover. Since the size is changing when you click, it would be confusing if both hovering and clicking changed the size.
