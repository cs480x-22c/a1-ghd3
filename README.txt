+  DESCRIPTION
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This Github repository contains my work for Assignment 1 in CS 480x. In the JS code I used the D3 library to create a happy face out of
circles, polygons and triangles of various colors.

+  TECHNICAL ACHIEVEMENT
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The technical achievement for this project was to learn how D3 works, specifically chaining. Multiple new D3 concepts were learned such as how
to create shapes from data sets, how to use anonymous functions to manipulate data and how to use some of D3's built-in features for drawing
shapes such as triangles and polygons.

+  DESIGN ACHIEVEMENT
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The design achievement for this project was to use all of the technical skills I learned about D3 and apply them to make a piece of art.
It involved me strategically using the SVG dimensions to carefully place shapes and make a happy face!
